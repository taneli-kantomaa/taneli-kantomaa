- 👋 Hi, I’m @taneli-kantomaa, an IT engineer working with Infrastructure-as-Code, Kubernetes, Terraform and other DevOps related context.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the essentials of these technologies and to be able to use these technologies the way they were intented to be used.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be able to better understand depedendencies and causalities within complex designs to enable the design of robust architectures and fast recovery in troubleshooting scenarios. I think Visualization and simulation could play key roles in this area.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people with the same interests.
- 📫 You can reach me with email: taneli.kantomaa@relexsolutions.com
